- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rob Mayo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development, mainly web development with Visual Studio, but also things like Raspberry Pi development, Python, and Shell Scripting.
For me, the fun is taking things from out of the box and bending them to my will.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, among other things

Buy me a coffee on Ko-Fi. Every little bit helps to "keep the lights on", so to speak.
